# 🎥 DynamiX - Plex Recommendations Manager

**DynamiX** is an automation tool for dynamically managing Plex collections. It pins and unpins library collections based on configurable time blocks, ensuring fresh and relevant content is featured. This repository includes the Python script and its packaged `.exe` version for easier execution.

## 🚀 **Features**

- **Dynamic Pinning**: Automatically pin collections based on time and day configurations.
- **Exclusion Handling**: Avoid re-pinning the same collection for a configurable period.
- **User Exemptions**: Allow manual exclusion of specific collections.
- **GUI Control**: Includes an intuitive graphical interface for configuration and monitoring.
- **Robust Logging**: Provides clear logs of actions and issues.

---

## 🔧 **Requirements**

- **Python 3.8+** *(for running the script)*
- **Plex Media Server**
- **Plex API Token** *(to authenticate and access the server)*
- Required Libraries: `plexapi`, `requests`, and `ttkbootstrap`

---

## 🛠️ **Installation**

### Option 1: Run the `.exe` File *(Recommended for Non-Developers)*
1. Download the latest `script.exe` from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/TheImaginear/DynamiX/releases).
2. Place it in a directory of your choice.
3. Double-click the `script.exe` to launch the application.

### Option 2: Run the Python Script
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DynamiX.git
   cd DynamiX
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python src/script.py
   ```
### Option 3: Run in Docker (Untested)

Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DynamiX.git
cd DynamiX

Build the Docker image:

docker build -t dynamix-plex .

Run the container:

docker run -d \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -v /path/to/config:/app/config \
    --name dynamix-container \
    dynamix-plex

Replace /path/to/config with the path to your local configuration files.

Access the GUI at http://localhost:8080.

## 📃 **Configuration**

### Initial Setup
Upon the first run, the application will prompt you to fill in required configuration details:

- **Plex URL**: The address of your Plex Media Server (e.g., `http://<server_ip>:32400`).
- **Plex Token**: A valid Plex API Token (refer to instructions below).
- **Libraries**: Comma-separated list of Plex libraries to manage (e.g., `Movies, TV Shows`).
- **Pinning Interval**: How often the program pins/unpins collections (in minutes).

### Configuration Files
The following files are generated and updated dynamically:

- `config.json` - Stores the main configuration settings.
- `used_collections.json` - Tracks recently pinned collections to avoid immediate repeats.
- `user_exemptions.json` - Maintains a list of collections manually exempted by the user.

---

## 💡 **Finding Your Plex Token**

To access the Plex API, you need a valid token. Follow these steps to retrieve it:

1. Open the Plex Web App and log in to your Plex server.
2. Select any media item (e.g., a movie or TV episode).
3. Click the `Get Info` button (3-dot menu) and choose `View XML`.
4. A new tab will open. In the URL, find the part after `X-Plex-Token=`.
5. Copy the token and paste it into the configuration.

---

## 💥 **Usage**

1. Launch the application (`script.exe` or `python src/script.py`).
2. Use the intuitive GUI to:
   - Configure Plex server details and dynamic pinning settings.
   - Manage exclusions and user exemptions.
   - View activity logs in real-time.
3. Start the automation process by clicking **"Run Main Function"** on the **Logs** tab.
